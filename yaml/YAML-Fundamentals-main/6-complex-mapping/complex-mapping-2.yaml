    YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language.
    It is commonly used for configuration files and in 
    applications where data is being stored or transmitted. 
    YAML targets many of the same communications applications 
    as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax 
    which intentionally differs from SGML.
